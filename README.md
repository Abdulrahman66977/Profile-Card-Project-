 üë§ Responsive Profile Card Component

Overview

This project is a clean, modern, and fully **responsive profile card component**, meticulously styled using **CSS3**. It demonstrates strong proficiency in creating visually engaging layouts, managing complex backgrounds, and ensuring accessibility standards.

This design is often used in social media interfaces or as a "social proof" element to display user stats.

  üöÄ Key Technical Highlights

1. Semantic HTML5: Uses appropriate tags (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<picture>`, `<h1>` for screen readers) to ensure **clean and accessible markup**.
2. Advanced CSS Layout: Implements **CSS Grid** for the main profile section (`.profile-card__profile`) and **CSS Flexbox** for the overall page body, showing mastery of modern layout techniques.
3. Custom Fonts & Variables: Utilizes a custom font (`KumbhSans`) and **CSS Variables** (`:root`) to ensure easy maintainability and consistent design across the component.
4. Complex Background Management: Demonstrates skill in handling multiple background images (`bk-pattern-top.svg`, `bk-pattern-bottom.svg`) with custom positioning (`background-position`) and repeat properties.
5. Visual Polish (Hover Effect): Implements a smooth **transform transition (scale and translate)** on the banner image when the profile card is hovered over, showcasing attention to detail and user experience.
6. Accessibility: Includes techniques for visually hiding header text (`.prf`) using best practices to aid screen readers.
